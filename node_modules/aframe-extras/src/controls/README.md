# Controls

**NOTE:** Parts of these controls components may be merged into A-Frame core in the future. See [aframevr/aframe#1248](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1248).

Extensible movement/rotation/hotkey controls, with support for a variety of input devices.

- **universal-controls**: Manager for other controls, which can be used to decide which input device is used when multiple are available, and to set common acceleration/sensitivity across all controls.

## Usage

Basic:

```html
<a-entity camera universal-controls></a-entity>
```

Extend with custom controls:

```html
<a-entity camera
          universal-controls="movementControls: custom, gamepad;"
          custom-controls></a-entity>
```

## Input devices:

- **checkpoint-controls**: Teleport or animate between checkpoints. See also: [checkpoint](/src/misc/checkpoint.js).
- **gamepad-controls**: Gamepad position + (optional) rotation controls.
- **hmd-controls**: HMD rotation / positional tracking controls.
- **keyboard-controls**: WASD+Arrow key movement controls, with improved support for ZQSD and Dvorak layouts.
- **mouse-controls**: Mouse + Pointerlock controls. *Non-VR / desktop only.*
- **touch-controls**: Touch-to-move controls, e.g. for Cardboard.

## Other Controls

I've written standalone components for several other control components.

- [gamepad-controls](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-gamepad-controls): A more advanced standalone gamepad controller than the version in this package.
- [keyboard-controls](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-keyboard-controls): A more advanced standalone keyboard controller than the version in this package.
- **leap-motion-controls**: *In progress.*

## Mobile + Desktop Input Devices

Connect input devices from your desktop to your mobile phone with WebRTC, using [ProxyControls.js](https://proxy-controls.donmccurdy.com).

## Mobile Gamepad Support
