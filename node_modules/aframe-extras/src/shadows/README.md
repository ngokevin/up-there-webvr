# Shadows

Runtime shadows, with the **shadow** and **shadow-light** components. Originally written by @ngokevin, and likely to be available in A-Frame later (https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-core/pull/348).

> *NOTE: Adding shadows to more than a few simple objects can slow your scene >down significantly. For performant shadows on scenery, like trees and houses, bake your shadows into your textures using modeling software.*
